    "These examples provides an overview of the `twpasolver` library's basic capabilities, focusing on the implementation of various circuit components and their compositions. The classes involved include `Models`, `TwoPortCell`, and `ABCDArrays`, which offer functionalities to handle one-port and two-port circuit components. The core functionalities are housed within `twpasolver.twoport` and `twpasolver.models`. \n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`twpasolver` provides simple functionalities to handle one-port and two-port circuit components. Each component is implemented as a class that defines how its ABCD matrix is computed as a function of an input frequency array. These models, which are derived from `twpasolver.twoport.TwoPortModel`, can be found in the ```twpasolver.models``` subpackage.\n",
    "The response of the circuit element is accessed by calling one of the ```get``` methods of the model class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_abcd(freq_array)` returns an instance of `twpasolver.ABCDArray`. It is a specialized subclass of `numpy.array` which is used to represent arrays of 2x2 matrices and includes efficient matrix multiplication operations. This class is the fundamental building block for constructing the response of concatenated circuit elements.\n",
    "* `get_cell(freq_array)` returns a `TwoPortCell` class, which contains an `ABCDArray`, a frequencies array, and additional functions to convert responses to S-parameters and `scikit-rf.Network` objects.\n",
    "* `get_network(freq_array)` directly returns a ```scikit-rf.Network``` with the computed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other features common to all models implemented in `twpasolver` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repetition of $N$ consecutive instances of the circuit through the `N` attribute.\n",
    "* Dumping and loading to/from json files and attribute validation, implemented through `pydantic`.\n",

Since one-port elements are specified entirely by their impedance response, they are specialized to allow connecting them in parallel or in series into another one port network, which simplifies calculations and makes it possible to create more complex elements to insert into a two-port circuit. \n",
