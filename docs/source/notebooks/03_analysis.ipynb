    "# 3WM gain and TWPAnalysis\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates how to utilize the `twpasolver.TWPAnalysis` class to simulate the gain response of a TWPA by solving the Coupled Mode Equations (CMEs) with a minimal model.\n",

    "`twpasolver.TWPAnalysis` automates the procedures required to compute the gain characteristics of a TWPA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculation of phase-matching profile, gain and bandwidth.\n",
    "* Automatic caching of data from the respectve `phase_matching()`, `gain()` and `bandwidth()` methods.\n",
    "* Sweeps over lists of input parameters for the analysis functions.\n",
    "* Simple plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the required libraries and initializing the `TWPAnalysis` instance. This object requires:\n",
    "* A `TWPA` instance or the name of a json file containing the definition of the model\n",
    "* A frequency span which determines the full region that will be considered in the analysis, which can be provided either as a list of values or a tuple that will be passed to `numpy.arange`. Some precautions in choosing the frequency span must be taken to correctly unwrap the phase response of the device. Namely, the frequency array should be dense enough and should start from frequencies much lower than the position of the stopband.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computed response and results of the following analysis functions are stored in the internal `data` dictionary, which can be accessed and saved to an hdf5 file through the `save_data()` method."
