    "# Advanced Coupled Mode Equations models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the advanced CMEs models to simulate the nonlinear response of a TWPA. We'll explore extended mode systems that go beyond the basic pump-signal-idler configuration to include pump harmonics, frequency conversion processes, and higher-order effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "While the basic 3-wave mixing (3WM) model provides a good starting point for TWPA analysis, real devices exhibit more complex behavior due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pump harmonics**: 2nd, 3rd, and higher harmonics of the pump frequency\n",
    "* **Frequency conversion**: Processes like pump + signal, pump + idler\n",
    "* **Signal/idler harmonics**: Higher harmonics of signal and idler modes\n",
    "* **Device imperfections**: Losses and reflections throughout the transmission line\n",
    "\n",
    "The `twpasolver` library handles these effects automatically through its `ModeArray` system and advanced CME solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize TWPAnalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load a KITWPA model and plot its response. Since we are going to consider higher order processes, we will initialize TWPAnalysis with a larger frequency span to capture pump harmonics."

    "## ModeArrays and ModeArrayFactory\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly describing the nonlinear response of TWPAs requires going beyond the basic CMEs system that considers only pump, signal and idler. `twpasolver` uses `ModeArray` objects to automatically build and solve CMEs systems including an arbitrary number of physical modes connected by frequency relationships.\n",

    "* **Dependency graph management**: Organizes mode relations and identifies independent modes\n",
    "* **Automatic parameter interpolation**: Extrapolates physical properties (frequency, wavenumber, losses) according to the relations\n",
    "* **RWA term selection**: Automatically selects the 3WM and 4WM terms that satisfy the Rotating Wave Approximation when solving the CMEs\n",
    "* **Symbolic frequency propagation**: Updates all related mode frequencies in O(n) time using pre-computed expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ModeArrayFactory` helps set up custom mode arrays or create standard extended mode collections.\n",
