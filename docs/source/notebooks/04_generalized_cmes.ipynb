    "Properly describing the nonlinear response of TWPAs requires going beyond the basic CMEs system that considers only pump, signal and idler. ```twpasolver``` is able to automatically build and solve CMEs systems including an arbitrary number of physical modes connected by relations between their frequencies. A collection of related modes is represented in a ```ModeArray``` object, which has the following notable features:\n",
    "- Organize the mode relations in a dependency graph, identifying the independent modes\n",
    "- Automatically extrapolate and propagate the physical propertie of the modes (frequency, wavenumber...) according to the relations\n",
    "- Automatically select the 3WM and 4WM terms that satisfy the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) when solving the CMEs\n",
